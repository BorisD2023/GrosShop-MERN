## Database

The GrosShop app uses MongoDB to store user data. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The app uses the `mongoose` library to connect to the database. The app uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables from the `.env` file. The Images are stored on `cloudinary`.

## Authentication

The GrosShop app uses JWT authentication. The app generates a JWT token when a user registers or logs in. The token is stored in local storage and is used to authenticate the user for protected routes. The token is valid for 24 hours. The app uses the `jsonwebtoken` library to generate and verify tokens. The app utilizes the `multer` middleware to manage file uploads. The app uses the `bcrypt` library to hash passwords. The app uses the `axios` library to make HTTP requests.

## Design

The app's wireframes were designed using Figma

## Deployment

The app is deployed using Render.com. Continuous deployment is set up to automatically deploy the app when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The app is deployed at https://grosshop.onrender.com/. On Render the app uses the following environment variables: `RESET_SECRET`, `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `TOKEN_SECRET`, `DB`, `PORT`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUDNAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`, `APP_NAME`.

## Third-Party Libraries & Tools

The GrosShop app uses the following third-party libraries:

- `axios` - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- `bcrypt` - A library to help you hash passwords
- `cors` - CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
- `dotenv` - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- `express` - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
- `jsonwebtoken` - An implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
- `mongoose` - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- `multer` - Middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js.
- `react-router-dom` - DOM bindings for React Router.
- `cloudinary` - Cloudinary is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image management pipeline.
